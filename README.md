# Exploring the Relationship Between Non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio (NHHR) and Sleep Disorders (OSA and Sleep Apnea) by Using NHANES Data

This research aims to investigate the association between the non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHHR) and two common sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

## Study Design

NHANES cycle (Need to merge two cycles):
- 2005-2006
- 2006-2007

### Demographic Data Included:
- Age
- Gender
- Race
- Marital status - Married, unmarried
- Education level (less than 9th grade, 9-11th, high school, some college, college graduate)
- Smoking status:
  - Never-smoker
  - Former smoker (smoking <100 cigarettes in the lifetime)
  - Yes (smoking ≥ 100)
- Alcohol consumption:
  - No alcohol use
  - 1-4 drinks per week
  - >4 drinks per week
- Physical activity:
  - Physically active
  - Physically inactive
- Dietary intake of cholesterol (24h recall survey, Total dietary cholesterol intake extracted from the total nutrient intake files using the mean amounts of two 24-h dietary recalls.)
- BMI
- Blood pressure & Cholesterol
- History of diabetes (Self-reported, physician diagnosis, or current insulin use)
- History of hypertension (Self-reported, physician diagnosis, or BP exceeded 140/90 mmHg)
- Cholesterol - HDL
- Cholesterol - LDL, Triglyceride & Apolipoprotein (ApoB)
- Cholesterol - Total

### Questionnaire: Sleep Disorder (n=6139)
Includes questions on sleep duration, snoring frequency, sleep disorder diagnosis, and various sleep-related troubles.

### Literature Search
Highlighted studies include works by Hou K. et al. on NHHR and periodontitis, Gong Q., Guo C. on lipid profiles and insomnia risk, and various studies investigating the relationship between sleep disorders and health metrics like sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, and more.

#### Clinical Feature Included:
BMI, marital status, smoking, alcohol drinking, hypertension, hyperglycemia, HDL-C, total cholesterol ⇒ NHHR.

This study utilizes logistic regression analysis to explore the association between NHHR and sleep disorders, drawing on data from various NHANES cycles and a wide array of demographic and health-related variables.
